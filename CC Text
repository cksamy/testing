Hi Team,

My Name is Karuppusamy.
Card No :  XXXX XXXX XXXX 7138
I got the message from SBI Card with out-standing payment as : 3356
I have not received any message last month, after that I checked my email for statement.
Last 3-4 months , every month putting the Fee,Tax, around Rs. 900 , I don’t know what is the original amount I need to pay.
Literally don’t want to use your service. Please let me know how to deactivate my card.
One More thing is there a way to cut down this fees ,  I want to pay the bill but can waive the late fees and other charges.
I have not used your service much but you put so much fees and tax and not even alerted me properly.
I want to hear from you.

Thanks & Regards,
Karuppusamy C
